                    For all three years on my Robotics team, 4627 Manning Robotics, I was the electrical captain.
                    I designed the electrial systems of the robot while working with the other team leads to
                    integrate all of the systems together. Additionally, during my final year I worked on 
                    redesigning the team's custom slimelight, more of which on the <a href="OpenMV7.html">OpenMV7 Slimelight Project</a>.
